    <p>
      As a coach, my goal is to give you the tools and self-understanding so that you can feel empowered to work towards your goals. I take a holistic view of a person, and identify patterns in what holds someone back as well as strategies to work around or overcome those patterns.
    </p>
    <p>
      I've worked with people through:
      <ul>
        <li>Career changes</li>
        <li>Navigating breakups with long-term partners</li>
        <li>Working through relationship uncertainties</li>
        <li>Early stage solo founder & cofounder issues</li>
        <li>Health goals</li>
      </ul>

    <blockquote>
      Problem-solving alongside Stephanie -- whether on interpersonal, strategic, tactical, or emotional challenges -- was consistently the greatest source of breakthroughs for me during an intensive one-year journey transitioning into the field of AI. Every conversation with her leaves you with a feeling of empowerment, clarity, motivation, and confidence. Every plan you form together will be empathetically probed for blind spots and failure modes until it's bulletproof. Asking for her advice is always worth it.

      Stephanie has this marvelous ability to take one look at you and know exactly what's going on. She approaches things with a critical eye, without ever being judgmental. She gently guides to insight, while making you feel all the better along the way

    <blockquote>
      When I first came to her a month ago, I was struggling a lot - I was finding it almost impossible to do productive work, having ridiculous sleep problems, and had just quit my gym and was really worried about getting out of shape, among a million other things.

      Basically through what can only be described as magic, in just a single month my sleep issues have been basically fully solved, I feel better and more productive than I have in as long as I can remember, and I’ve started and stayed consistent with the most rigorous and rewarding workout routine I’ve ever had in my life and am convinced I’ll be in the best shape of my life in just a few more months. I woke up today and realized I felt *insanely* good about almost everything in my life - something I almost can’t believe and that I’m unbelievably grateful to Stephanie for helping me achieve.
