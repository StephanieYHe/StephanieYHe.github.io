    <p class="subtitle">Are you looking to create and sustain long-term changes in your life?</p>
    <p>
      As a coach, my goal is to give you the tools and self-understanding so that you can feel empowered to pay attention to your intuitions and work towards your dreams. I take a holistic view of a person, and identify patterns in what holds someone back as well as strategies to work around or overcome those patterns. Together, we'll work on creatively problem solving and exploring new options that you may not have considered already.
    </p>

      I've worked with people through:
      <ul>
        <li>Career changes</li>
        <li>Navigating breakups with long-term partners</li>
        <li>Working through relationship uncertainties</li>
        <li>Early stage solo founder & cofounder issues</li>
        <li>Health goals</li>
      </ul>

    <blockquote>
      Problem-solving alongside Stephanie -- whether on interpersonal, strategic, tactical, or emotional challenges -- was consistently the greatest source of breakthroughs for me during an intensive one-year journey transitioning into the field of AI. Every conversation with her leaves you with a feeling of empowerment, clarity, motivation, and confidence. Every plan you form together will be empathetically probed for blind spots and failure modes until it's bulletproof. Asking for her advice is always worth it.

      Stephanie has this marvelous ability to take one look at you and know exactly what's going on. She approaches things with a critical eye, without ever being judgmental. She gently guides to insight, while making you feel all the better along the way

      Stephanie is as smart at problem solving as she is with emotions, relationship, and compassion, and it’s a real gift to be able to work through problems with her. 

      Her talents include remarkable candor, a unique ability to clearly help you map out the area you’re in and the paths you have ahead, intense compassion without injecting herself into any situation, and a hopefulness and optimism that has helped me through the most difficult times of my life!

      She’s the ultimate tool for someone who just wants to work through life’s messy parts as effectively as possible, and enjoy doing so!

      Stephanie has a gift of being able to listen intently and uncover what’s really going on beneath the surface. She has a powerful way of validating me while also challenging my assumptions, all in the name of helping me live my best life. I love her dynamic style, which is fun, provocative, and sprinkled with insightful perspective from her own experiences. I’m grateful for the opportunity to have worked with her!

    <blockquote>
      When I first came to her a month ago, I was struggling a lot - I was finding it almost impossible to do productive work, having ridiculous sleep problems, and had just quit my gym and was really worried about getting out of shape, among a million other things.

      Basically through what can only be described as magic, in just a single month my sleep issues have been basically fully solved, I feel better and more productive than I have in as long as I can remember, and I’ve started and stayed consistent with the most rigorous and rewarding workout routine I’ve ever had in my life and am convinced I’ll be in the best shape of my life in just a few more months. I woke up today and realized I felt *insanely* good about almost everything in my life - something I almost can’t believe and that I’m unbelievably grateful to Stephanie for helping me achieve.

    <blockquote>
      Stephanie is not a catalyst; the obstacles you face are just as difficult as before. She simply siphons so much raw energy into you that you're able to overcome then. It's not exactly positivity or optimism that she provides, though there is plenty of that too. What she brings is more... inexorable. It's kind of a surreal experience.

    <blockquote>
      Stephanie helped me overcome self-limiting beliefs in my professional life ("I'm not good enough to attempt this project") as well as barriers in my personal relationships ("I'm scared to express these vulnerable emotions to my friends / partner"). After some sessions, you'll look back and go "what in the, how did my life magically get so much better?!"
