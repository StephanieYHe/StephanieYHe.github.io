      <blockquote>What are stamps?</blockquote>
      A postage stamp is a small piece of paper that is affixed to mail to indicate that the postage has been paid for. As a result, stamps both have the value of the postage price they represent, in addition to their value as a collector's item.

      <blockquote>Why collect stamps?</blockquote>
      Stamp collecting is an educational hobby that allows one to explore the rich nuances of history and culture through time.

      <blockquote>What are tools I need for stamp collecting?</blockquote>
      While stamp collecting requires very few tools, there are some tools that are essential for maintaining pristine stamps. Most common instruments include: stamp tongs to move stamps without causing damage or dirtying with skin oils, a magnifying glass to better identify details for stamp identification and watermark detectors to identify marked paper.

      <blockquote>How do you remove a stamp from an envelope?</blockquote>
      In a process known as soaking stamps, one can carefully remove the stamp with minimal damage. First, trim the paper around the stamp while leaving the stamp intact. Then, place the stamp face side up in a few inches of lukewarm water and wait 2-3 minutes for the stamps to float. Wait until the stamps are completely free without trying to pull the stamp, which can cause tearing. Afterwards, rinse the back of the stamp gently to remove the glue. Finally, place the stamp between two paper towels and put a weight on top. Let it stand overnight.
